Human Pose Estimation, Densely Connected Residual Module

# Lightweight Densely Connected Residual Network for Human Pose Estimation

## Introduction
This is an official pytorch implementation of Lightweight Densely Connected Residual Network for Human Pose Estimation. In this work, a new module named Densely Connected Residual Module (DCRM) is presented to effectively decrease the number of parameters in our network. We introduce our module to the backbone of High-Resolution Net. In addition, we change direct addition fusion into pyramid fusion at the end of the network. No need for ImageNet pre-training sharply decreases the total time of our training processes. We do our experiments over two benchmark datasets: the COCO keypoint detection dataset and the MPII Human Pose dataset. As a result, we achieve a decrease on number of parameters and calculated amount

## Environment
The code is developed using python 3.6 on Ubuntu 16.04. NVIDIA GPUs are needed. The code is developed and tested using 4 NVIDIA P100 GPU cards. Other platforms or GPU cards are not fully tested.

## Quick start
### Installation
1. Install pytorch >= v1.0.0 following [official instruction](https://pytorch.org/).
2. Clone this repo, and we'll call the directory that you cloned as ${POSE_ROOT}.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Make libs:
   ```
   cd ${POSE_ROOT}/lib
   make
   ```
5. Install [COCOAPI](https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi):
   ```
   # COCOAPI=/path/to/clone/cocoapi
   git clone https://github.com/cocodataset/cocoapi.git $COCOAPI
   cd $COCOAPI/PythonAPI
   # Install into global site-packages
   make install
   # Alternatively, if you do not have permissions or prefer
   # not to install the COCO API into global site-packages
   python3 setup.py install --user
   ```
   Note that instructions like # COCOAPI=/path/to/install/cocoapi indicate that you should pick a path where you'd like to have the software cloned and then set an environment variable (COCOAPI in this case) accordingly.
4. Init output(training model output directory) and log(tensorboard log directory) directory:

   ```
   mkdir output 
   mkdir log
   ```

   Your directory tree should look like this:

   ```
   ${POSE_ROOT}
   ├── data
   ├── experiments
   ├── lib
   ├── log
   ├── models
   ├── output
   ├── visualization
   ├── tools 
   ├── README.md
   └── requirements.txt
   ```
   
### Data preparation
**For MPII data**, please download from [MPII Human Pose Dataset](http://human-pose.mpi-inf.mpg.de/). The original annotation files are in matlab format. We have converted them into json format, you also need to download them from [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AhIXJn_J-blW00SqrairNetmeVu4) or [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1En_VqmStnsXMdldXA6qpqEyDQulnmS3a?usp=sharing).
Extract them under {POSE_ROOT}/data, and make them look like this:
```
${POSE_ROOT}
|-- data
`-- |-- mpii
    `-- |-- annot
        |   |-- gt_valid.mat
        |   |-- test.json
        |   |-- train.json
        |   |-- trainval.json
        |   `-- valid.json
        `-- images
            |-- 000001163.jpg
            |-- 000003072.jpg
```

**For COCO data**, please download from [COCO download](http://cocodataset.org/#download), 2017 Train/Val is needed for COCO keypoints training and validation. We also provide person detection result of COCO val2017 and test-dev2017 to reproduce our multi-person pose estimation results. Please download from [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/f/s!AhIXJn_J-blWzzDXoz5BeFl8sWM-) or [GoogleDrive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fRUDNUDxe9fjqcRZ2bnF_TKMlO0nB_dk?usp=sharing).
Download and extract them under {POSE_ROOT}/data, and make them look like this:
